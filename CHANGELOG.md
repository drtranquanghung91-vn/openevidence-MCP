# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-16

### Added
- `oe_ask.model` — choose the OpenEvidence answer model: `osler` (default), `sackett`, or `snow` (deep long-form research). The selection is made in the OpenEvidence UI before submitting and verified against the created article's `model_profile_name`, which is now returned in the `created` payload.
- `oe_ask.timeout_sec` may now be up to 900 seconds so a Snow answer can be awaited in one call.
- `Table` widgets in answers are rendered as markdown pipe tables (from `table_text`, falling back to `table_data`).
- Raw `<h2>`/`<h3>`/`<h4>` headings in answers are converted to markdown headings.

### Fixed
- Snow answers lost their summary tables because the `Table` widget was treated as unknown and dropped.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- Detection of OpenEvidence's location-restriction ("Unavailable") page: `oe_auth_status` now returns `blocked: "geo"` with VPN guidance instead of a misleading "not authenticated", and `oe_ask`/`oe_history_list`/`oe_article_get` fail with the same actionable message.
- `oe_citations_get` tool for structured citation extraction and BibTeX export, with optional Crossref DOI enrichment.
- Citation extraction on normalized article payloads via the `citations` field.
- Explicit `timed_out` flags for article waiting flows so agents can distinguish incomplete results from failures.
- Cross-platform CI matrix for Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS across Node.js 20, 22, and 24.
- `prepare` script so npm installs from git build the TypeScript output automatically.

### Changed
- `oe_ask` now exposes only parameters that are actually sent to OpenEvidence: `question`, optional `original_article_id`, and wait/poll controls.
- Server metadata now reads the package version instead of returning a hardcoded version.
- `oe_auth_status` no longer performs a redundant authenticated client check.
- README and all seven translated README files now document the `login:session` browser-profile flow, fire-and-forget asks, and citation export.
- `server.json` now uses real optional environment variables instead of placeholder API-key fields.

### Removed
- Removed legacy `npm run login`, `npm run login:browser`, and storage-state import flows from the package scripts and user docs.
- Removed unused legacy login entrypoints and local marketing/scratch artifacts from the repository.

### Fixed
- Browser launch now drives Chrome's modern headless mode via an explicit `--headless=new` flag instead of the Playwright-injected legacy `--headless`, fixing session-launch failures on Chrome 150+ environments (#23, thanks @itamarlssf-commits).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- Documentation and install guidance were synchronized around the system-browser `login:session` workflow.
- Smoke-test and troubleshooting guidance clarified that a real local browser session is required.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- `npm run login:browser` to guide users through Edge/Chrome Google SSO login using system profiles.
- Modular, robust `npm run login:session` and automated login runners.
- Node.js test workflow CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/test.yml`).
- Compact "Agent Onboarding & Installation" copyable prompts with dedicated `docs/AGENT_INSTALL_PROMPT.md` runbook.

### Changed
- Refactored `oe_ask` for headless and headful session runner stability.
- Enhanced security: redacted browser verification HTML and raw HTML dumps in error states to prevent private data exposure.
- Standardized technical and medical terms for clinical researchers across all files.
- Fully synchronized and polished all 7 translations: `README.ru.md`, `README.es.md`, `README.zh-Hans.md`, `README.zh-Hant-TW.md`, `README.ko.md`, `README.hi.md`, and `README.AI.md`.
