# OpenEvidence MCP (Unofficial)

**The first open-source OpenEvidence MCP server (published February 2026).** Query OpenEvidence from Codex, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible client through your own authenticated browser session. No API key. One-command installer for 7 MCP clients. Fire-and-forget asks with polling. Structured citations with BibTeX export.

> **Fork notes (drtranquanghung91-vn/openevidence-MCP)** — based on upstream `feat/v0.3.0-cleanup-and-features` plus:
> - Detection of OpenEvidence's location-restriction ("not available in your location") page. `oe_auth_status` now returns `blocked: "geo"` with VPN guidance instead of a misleading `authenticated: false`, and `oe_ask` / `oe_history_list` / `oe_article_get` raise the same actionable message. See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` → *Location Restriction Page*.
> - OpenEvidence is geo-restricted (e.g. not reachable from Vietnam); run the MCP server from a supported region or through a VPN.
> - `oe_ask.model` (`osler` / `sackett` / `snow`) plus markdown rendering of Snow tables and headings (v0.3.1).

## How it works

```
MCP client (Codex / Claude / Cursor / ...)
        │  stdio
        ▼
openevidence-mcp server (local Node process)
        │  Playwright on YOUR system Chrome/Edge
        ▼
dedicated local browser profile (~/.openevidence-mcp)
        │  your own logged-in OpenEvidence session
        ▼
openevidence.com
```

You log in once in a real browser window (`npm run login:session`). After that, the MCP server drives a minimized local browser on that profile — cookies never leave the browser, nothing is exported, no extension is installed, no ports are opened.

## What it does

- checks whether the saved session is authenticated;
- lists your OpenEvidence question/article history;
- fetches a full article payload by ID;
- asks an OpenEvidence research question — blocking or **fire-and-forget** (`wait_for_completion=false`, then poll);
- polls an existing OpenEvidence article until it completes, with an explicit `timed_out` flag;
- extracts **structured citations** from a completed article and exports **BibTeX** (optional Crossref DOI enrichment).

No official OpenEvidence API token is required.

## What it does NOT do

- It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or approved by OpenEvidence.
- It does not provide medical advice or replace clinical judgment.
- It does not collect credentials or ask for your password.
- It does not send your browser session state anywhere except to OpenEvidence through local requests from your machine.
- It should not be used for patient-specific diagnosis or treatment decisions without appropriate human review.

## Who it is for

- clinicians using their own OpenEvidence account;
- medical researchers who need citations they can drop into a reference manager;
- AI operators building evidence-research workflows;
- MCP developers integrating local tools with Codex, Claude, Cursor, Cline, Continue, or similar clients.

## Agent Onboarding & Installation

Using Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or another local AI coding agent? Let the agent handle the entire setup:

```text
Please install OpenEvidence MCP for me: clone https://github.com/bakhtiersizhaev/openevidence-mcp, install dependencies, run build, auto-configure this MCP server in my local client (Claude Desktop/Codex/Cursor), guide me through the one-time Edge/Chrome login using `npm run login:session`, and run `npm run smoke` to verify. Keep everything strictly local and secure.
```

For the comprehensive, step-by-step setup playbook and rules, see **[docs/AGENT_INSTALL_PROMPT.md](docs/AGENT_INSTALL_PROMPT.md)**.

## Features

| Tool | Purpose | Auth required | Side effects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `oe_auth_status` | Checks whether the saved OpenEvidence browser session is authenticated. | Yes, local browser profile must be logged in. | None. |
| `oe_history_list` | Lists prior OpenEvidence articles with optional pagination and search. Returns a privacy-reduced list unless `include_raw=true` is explicitly requested. | Yes. | None. |
| `oe_article_get` | Fetches an article by ID and returns normalized fields (`status`, `is_complete`, `question`, `answer_text`, `citations`). Raw payload is opt-in with `include_raw=true`. | Yes. | None. |
| `oe_article_wait` | Waits for an existing article ID to complete; returns `timed_out=true` when the timeout elapsed before completion. | Yes. | None. |
| `oe_ask` | Creates an OpenEvidence research question and optionally waits for the article to complete. `model` selects `osler` (default, fast), `sackett` (complex cases) or `snow` (deep long-form research, 4–7 min). Set `wait_for_completion=false` for fire-and-forget. | Yes. | Creates a question/article in your OpenEvidence account. |
| `oe_citations_get` | Extracts structured citations from a completed article and returns JSON + BibTeX. `validate_crossref=true` enriches DOI entries with Crossref metadata. | Yes. | None. |

## Tested / Target Clients

| Client | Status | Notes |

| OpenAI Codex / Codex CLI / Codex app | Target | Recommended local MCP workflow. |
| Claude Code | Target | Recommended agent workflow. |
| Claude Desktop / Claude app with MCP support | Target | Local MCP server configuration. |
| Cursor | Compatible | MCP-compatible IDE workflow. |
| Cline | Compatible | VS Code agent workflow. |
| Continue | Compatible | Open-source IDE assistant workflow. |
| VS Code / GitHub Copilot environments with MCP support | Experimental | Depends on local MCP support and client configuration. |
| Windsurf / Zed / Replit / Sourcegraph-style MCP hosts | Experimental | Windsurf is covered by the installer. |
| Gemini CLI / Google Antigravity-style agent environments | Experimental | Antigravity is covered by the installer. |

## Agent Tool-Calling Notes

The MCP server includes built-in instructions and a prompt named `openevidence_research_workflow` for clients that expose MCP prompts.

Recommended agent workflow:

1. Call `oe_auth_status` when auth state is unknown.
2. Use `oe_history_list` only when the user wants prior OpenEvidence work or an article ID.
3. Use `oe_article_get` when you already have an article ID.
4. For long research questions, call `oe_ask` with `wait_for_completion=false`, then call `oe_article_wait` with the returned `article_id`.
5. Use `original_article_id` only for true follow-up continuity. Omit it for fresh questions to avoid stale thread context.
6. Call `oe_citations_get` when the user needs references or BibTeX from a completed article.
7. Treat outputs as evidence-research context, not medical advice, diagnosis, or clinical orders.

Related commands:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run login:session` | One-time login. Opens Chrome/Edge with the local OpenEvidence MCP profile. |
| `npm run smoke` | Verifies auth and basic OpenEvidence connectivity. |

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+
- OpenEvidence account
- macOS, Windows, or Linux
- Chrome, Edge, or Chromium installed on your system

## Availability Note

OpenEvidence availability may depend on region, account eligibility, and OpenEvidence policy. Public materials in May 2026 indicate verified U.S. HCP/NPI-centered access and EU/U.K. unavailability; this project does not change those restrictions.

## Quick Start

### macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bakhtiersizhaev/openevidence-mcp.git
cd openevidence-mcp
./scripts/setup-macos.sh
npm run login:session
npm run smoke
```

### Ubuntu/Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bakhtiersizhaev/openevidence-mcp.git
cd openevidence-mcp
./scripts/setup-ubuntu.sh
npm run login:session
npm run smoke
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/bakhtiersizhaev/openevidence-mcp.git
cd openevidence-mcp
.\scripts\setup-windows.ps1
npm run login:session
npm run smoke
```

## Login Flow

One-time login:

```bash
npm run login:session
```

The command opens Chrome or Edge with a local OpenEvidence MCP browser profile. Sign in to OpenEvidence with your own account, confirm the normal OpenEvidence page loads, close that browser window, return to the terminal, and press Enter.

Default local profile path:

- macOS/Linux: `~/.openevidence-mcp/browser-profile`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.openevidence-mcp\browser-profile`

The MCP server reuses this same local profile during its process lifetime. It may start a minimized local browser process for OpenEvidence calls, but it does not install an extension, expose a public network service, export cookies, or ask for your password.

Do not share browser profile files, cookies, screenshots with private account data, or patient-identifiable information.

## MCP Client Setup

Build before registering the server:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)

Register the OpenEvidence MCP server with your client using the built-in installer:

| Client | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Desktop | `npx openevidence-mcp install --client claude-app` |
| Codex Desktop | `npx openevidence-mcp install --client codex-app` |
| Claude Code | `npx openevidence-mcp install --client claude-code` |
| Codex CLI | `npx openevidence-mcp install --client codex-cli` |
| Google Antigravity | `npx openevidence-mcp install --client antigravity` |
| Cursor | `npx openevidence-mcp install --client cursor` |
| Windsurf | `npx openevidence-mcp install --client windsurf` |

Each client also has an npm shortcut, e.g. `npm run install:cursor`. To uninstall:

```bash
npx openevidence-mcp uninstall --client <client-id>
```

### Manual Setup

#### Codex

Add this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.openevidence]
command = "node"
args = ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/openevidence-mcp/dist/server.js"]
startup_timeout_sec = 60
```

Windows example:

```toml
[mcp_servers.openevidence]
command = "node"
args = ["C:\\Users\\<user>\\openevidence-mcp\\dist\\server.js"]
startup_timeout_sec = 60
```

#### Claude Desktop

Add this to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openevidence": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/openevidence-mcp/dist/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor, Cline, Continue

Use the same stdio server shape if your client supports MCP server command/args configuration:

```json
{
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/openevidence-mcp/dist/server.js"]
}
```

Example configs are in `examples/`.

## Verify

```bash
npm run smoke
```

Expected result with a valid session:

- `ok: true`
- `authenticated: true`
- a redacted history preview

If smoke fails with an auth error, run `npm run login:session` again. Smoke requires a real OpenEvidence account session and will not pass in a clean CI environment unless a local session profile is available.

By default, smoke output redacts account and history content. Use `npm run smoke -- --verbose` only in a private terminal if raw account/history payloads are needed for debugging.

Developer checks:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm run check
```

## Security Notes

- Treat browser profiles and cookies as secrets.
- Do not commit `.env`, session state, screenshots with account data, or patient-identifiable information.
- Use only your own OpenEvidence account.
- Keep MCP client configs pointed at the built local server path you control.
- Review tool calls from autonomous agents before using outputs in clinical or operational workflows.
- See `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting and supported scope.

## Troubleshooting

See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed recovery steps.

Common fixes:

- `authenticated: false`: rerun `npm run login:session`.
- MCP client cannot start server: confirm `npm run build` succeeded and use an absolute path to `dist/server.js`.
- Windows path issues: escape backslashes in JSON/TOML or use full absolute paths.
- Node errors: confirm `node --version` is 20 or newer.
- OpenEvidence UI/API changed: open an issue with sanitized logs and no private account or patient data.
- `oe_ask` cannot find the question input or submit button: OpenEvidence UI may have changed; open an issue with sanitized logs and no private account or patient data.

## Roadmap

- Publish to the official MCP Registry (`server.json` manifest is ready).
- Crossref-validated citation metadata caching.
- Optional article artifacts on disk (answer.md, citations.bib).
- Track MCP client setup examples as client configuration formats evolve.
